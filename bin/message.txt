I am a junior undergraduate at IIT Delhi, and am contacting you on behalf of Alumni Affairs and International Programmes(AAIP), IIT Delhi. Firstly, let me congratulate you on receiving the donor scholarship award. It's extremely inspiring for us as students to see you innovate and excel.  

We wish to promote this culture by encouraging alumni to give scholarships to students bubbling with ideas and the will to innovate. This will enable us to establish a very strong and beneficial bond between alumni and students.  

Therefore, we would like to cover your story and display it on our website as an example for others to follow. It will be great if you could let me know when you are free to give the interview in the coming week(11th March'18-18th March'18) and then we can fix a time accordingly. Hoping for a prompt reply.

Cheers!
